            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Rio Verde Pool Service was founded by Dave Harmon in 2009 after he relocated to Rio Verde from San Diego. A marine veteran with a background in water treatment, Dave saw firsthand how the Arizona desert took a toll on pools — and how many homeowners were being overcharged for mediocre service.</p>
            <p>He started with a truck, a test kit, and six clients. Today, we maintain over 200 pools across Rio Verde, Tonto Verde, Fort McDowell, and the surrounding foothills. Our growth has been entirely through referrals and reputation — we've never needed to advertise because our work speaks for itself.</p>

            <h2>Why Rio Verde Trusts Us</h2>
            <p>We're not a franchise. We're not a corporate outfit that sends a different person every week. We're a small, tight-knit team of pool professionals who live in this community. When you call us, you get Dave or one of his senior technicians — not a call center.</p>
            <p>Every technician on our team is CPO-certified (Certified Pool Operator) and undergoes regular training on the latest pool technology and chemical best practices. We stay current so your pool stays perfect.</p>

            <h2>Our Commitment to Rio Verde</h2>
            <p>We understand that your pool is a significant investment and a centerpiece of outdoor living here in the Valley. Whether you're in one of Rio Verde's gated golf communities or a custom home in the foothills, we treat every pool as if it were our own.</p>
