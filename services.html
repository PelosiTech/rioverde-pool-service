            <h2>Weekly Pool Cleaning &amp; Maintenance</h2>
            <p>Our most popular service keeps your Rio Verde pool in perfect condition all year long. Each weekly visit includes skimming the surface, brushing walls and tile, vacuuming the floor, emptying baskets, testing and balancing water chemistry, and inspecting all equipment.</p>
            <p>Arizona's intense sun and dust storms mean your pool needs consistent attention. Our technicians understand the specific challenges Rio Verde pools face — from hard water mineral buildup to the rapid chlorine loss caused by UV exposure. We adjust our chemical treatments seasonally to keep your water balanced and inviting.</p>
            <p><strong>What's included:</strong> Surface skimming, wall &amp; tile brushing, floor vacuuming, basket cleaning, chemical testing &amp; balancing, equipment inspection, filter pressure check.</p>

            <p>Our process includes shock treatment, algae elimination, thorough brushing, filter cleaning, and complete water rebalancing. We'll also diagnose what caused the issue to prevent it from happening again.</p>

            <p>A clean filter is essential for clear water and efficient circulation. We provide thorough filter cleans — whether you have a cartridge, DE, or sand filter. We recommend filter cleaning every 3-4 months in Rio Verde due to the high dust and debris common in the desert environment.</p>
